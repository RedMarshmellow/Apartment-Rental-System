The two members of this team are roommates so communication was trivial

Program Testing was done by testing adding users, attempting logins, adding apartments, deleting apartments. The test database is provided in the files.The first .py file to be executed, after DataBaseCreation.py, is index.py. It serves as the Login/Registration Page and redirects to the Apartment management page. 
Attempting to access main.py directly will result in redirection to index.py.

DataBaseCreation.py is included and is capable of reconstructing the database,it is not however capable of overwriting the existing database should one exist.
It automatically populates the CITY table with the records provided. 
The Database file must be titled "rent.db" for the sake of functionality.
